# Time-series-Forecasting

The aim of this project is to forecast the sales and understand the impact of customer footfall and promotions on sales given the dataset for 15 stores. 

The sales impact customer footfalls and customers in turn impact sales, which implies that the number of customers is endogenous. Other variables like promotions and holidays impact the sales and are called exogenous as their impact is unidirectional, sales doesn't impact holidays or promotions. Here the major goal is to forecast sales considering both endogenous and exogenous variables. And with the given time series nature of the data, measurement of the impact of endogenous and exogenous variables is done with Impulse Response Functions.
